## TASK 2:

Draw up a DevOps process and explain what each represents 

### Continuous Integration
DevOps practice ensures that developers can make numerous daily modifications to the an application source code via a shared repository. This get to be tested and reported. Continuous integration aims at providing quick feedback so that any flaws can be fixed right away.




### Continuous Testing

In other to get quick input on any business risk connected to the product or software release, continuos test is required to ensure high quality product. As such automated testing tools are used to automate the testing phase as and when the codebase it modified. testing each small piece of code as and when it is push to the repo.



### Continuous Delivery
Continuous delivery is the ability to do changes including new feature, configuration, bug fixes, ect into production. The motive is to continuously improve the application. If there is an error in the production code, it is quickly fixed.




### Continuous Deployment
Code is automatically deployed to the production environment as it passes through all the test cases. Alternate version of the code are always present in the right places as a result of continuos updates. every updates to the code is automatically deployed with  the help of DevOps deployment tools leading to several deployments in the production environment every day.


### Continuous Monitoring
DevOps process make room for a reporting tool that ensure developer and tester can assess the functionality and performance of their application before it it implemented. Therefore to reduce the number of errors, continuos monitoring provides feedback for further action.



### Continuous Planning
This process begins with determining the resources required by an application. Here the  results or outcomes and capabilities of an application, the key technologies , etc leans from the customers needs.
