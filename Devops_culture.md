## TASK 1:

What is your understanding of a DevOps Culture in an Organization ( Explain in not less than 500 words ) 

### Definition:

DevOps is a combination of two words: Development and Operations. So DevOps as used in IT refers to a process that ensures collaboration and communication between Development team/process and IT operations. 


### DevOps Culture
Culture is basically , the way a group of people do their things. So putting the two together, I can say that DevOps Culture is the practice where there is a continuos collaboration between development as a process and IT operations, this is not limited to personal or tools.

This practice often results in value for customers, ensure there is automation and continuos delivery of products and services that meet customer expectation.
